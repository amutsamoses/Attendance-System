Embedded System Project: RFID Based Attendance System

RFID Based Attendance System Using 8051 Microcontroller
Nowadays, attendance in schools and colleges is based on paper. Sometimes this process causes errors and takes more time.

This project uses RFID technology for making a note of every student entering in a classroom and also calculates the time resides in a class.

In this system every student is allotted with an RFID tag. The attendance can be done by placing card near RFID reader.

What is RFID?
The Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is an electronic device which includes a small antenna and a chip. This device is used for transmitting information between reader and RFID tag using radio frequency electromagnetic fields.



The attendance system in most of schools and colleges is mostly documented based. For automatic attendance system a wireless technology based RFID system is proposed. Every student is provided with an RFID tag, which uses inbuilt IC for storing and processing the information.
